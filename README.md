BOING is my very first game. I released it back in 2016 on Lexaloffle and itch.io, coding it in my spare time over the course of a week. 
The game is a not so accurate recreation of Pong, in the sense that, unlike the classic, BOING features paddles that accelerate, and the ability to give the ball a slight spin by hitting it at the right speed. Local multiplayer is available, as well as single player against a simple AI.

## Player controls:
